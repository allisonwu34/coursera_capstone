They can know before they move that their new area has resources and venues that will interest them and help them adjust to their new environment more quickly because it is actually familiar and comfortable. This is of personal interest to this data scientist who is looking to relocate to a new city soon.\n\nFor someone who currently lives in one city, how can we find the most similar neighborhood in a another city based on the kinds of venues that are most common in that neighborhood? \n\nIn this project, we will explore this question - specifically for someone who currently lives in __Charleston, South Carolina__, is moving to __Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania__, and is interested in neighborhood similarity based on the number of __craft breweries__ in that neighborhood. Additionally, we will look at median home values in those neighborhoods to better inform our decision about where to relocate with a home-buying budget of USD $300,000."

            "source": "Our analysis shows that the Charleston neighborhood with the highest frequency of brewery as a venue within a one-mile radius of city center is Silver Hill-Magnolia, with a frequency of 0.24. This means that almost a quarter of the venues in this neighborhood are categorized as a brewery. At the end of 2020, this neighborhood had a median home value of $205,635.00.\n\nOur analysis also shows that there are two Pittsburgh neighborhoods with the highest frequency of brewery as a venue within a one-mile radius of city center with a frequency of 0.125 - Spring Garden and Upper Lawrenceville. At the end of 2020, these neighborhoods had median home values of $129,360.00 and $251,403.00, respectively. \n\nHowever, the intention of this project is to find the neighborhoods which are most similar between Charleston and Pittsburgh based on the frequency of breweries as a venue. Based on this criteria, Silver Hill-Magnolia is not very similar to Spring Garden or Upper Lawrenceville. We can take another look at Charleston neighborhoods and find that East Central has a frequency of breweries as a venue of 0.112903. This is still not a perfect match but is more similar to the frequency of 0.125 found in Spring Garden & Upper Lawrenceville. Although we do not need the median home value in East Central to inform our home-buying decision in Pittsburgh, we can see that the median home value at the end of 2020 in East Central was $343,867.00.\n\nOf course, it would be most helpful to see what current (January 2021) median home values are in the identified neighborhoods, but that data is not yet available from Zillow. There was also a bit of manual data cleaning that was involved in our process because home neighborhoods are more specific and narrowly bounded than neighborhoods for venues, based on Foursquare's API data. In order to compare as many neighborhoods as possible and visualize breweries all across each city, the decision was made to manually enter the city center coordinates for each neighborhood that was not defined by the Foursquare API. This process may be easier for bigger/more populous/more tourist-centric cities because the data may be more robust. Additional analysis on neighborhoods can be done with other factors, such as school districts, proximity to grocery stores, and/or proximity to a known workplace (if relocation is due to job change), to help narrow down the ideal neighborhood(s) even more."

            "source": "The purpose of this project was to find the most similar neighborhoods between Charleston, SC and Pittsburgh, PA based on the number of breweries in each neighborhood. A secondary purpose of this project was to evaluate median home value in each of those neighborhoods to inform and narrow down our search for a new home while relocating from Charleston to Pittsburgh. Our analysis consisted of taking neighborhoods for which we have home value data and examining the venues within those neighborhoods to identify the frequency of breweries within each neighborhood. Once we found which neighborhoods had the most breweries, we could easily compare the neighborhoods from Charleston and Pittsburgh to find which ones were most similar/had the closest frequency of breweries per neighbrhood. Based on our analysis, we can say that the Spring Garden and Upper Lawrenceville neighborhoods in Pittsburgh are most similar to the Silver Hill-Magnolia neighborhood in Charleston. We can also easily compare median home values in these neighborhoods. We can see that median home values in Spring Garden and Upper Lawrenceville fall well below our home-buying budget of $300,000. \n\nThus, we can conclude that moving from Charleston to either Spring Garden or Upper Lawrenceville will help a craft beer enthusiast feel at home in their new surroundings more quickly because of the greater frequency of a venue of interest. We can also conclude that moving to either of these neighborhoods will be affordable for this relocator since neither neighborhood's median home value exceeds the predetermined budget of $300,000. "
